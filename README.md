# mcObd — personal profile & portfolio hub

This repository is a small personal hub for Obodos McQuendie (mcObd). The original, full profile README (with badges, featured projects and contact links) has been preserved in `PROFILE_README.md` so you can view or edit it separately.

This `README.md` is intentionally concise so the repo is easy to scan.

## Quick links

- Full profile (display content): `PROFILE_README.md`
- GitHub profile: https://github.com/mcObd
- Portfolio: https://project-flux.vercel.app/ (if available)

## How to view

- On GitHub: open this repository to see the profile and badges rendered.
- Locally: open `PROFILE_README.md` in a Markdown viewer, or view the repo on GitHub to see rendered badges and images.

## Repository structure

```
mcObd/
├─ .git/
├─ .github/
├─ PROFILE_README.md   # full profile content (backup)
└─ README.md           # this concise project README
```

## Notes

- If you'd like the full profile to remain as the main README, I moved it to `PROFILE_README.md` so this file can act as a compact project description. If you prefer the original to stay as `README.md`, tell me and I will restore it.
